      <h1>Welcome to Amazing Adventures with MicroChipCoding!</h1>
      <p>You can learn more about my amazing adventures in many topics, such as coding, gaming, sports, food, and school!</p>
      <h2>My Coding Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>code.org</b></li>
          <p>I first learned code.org in Kindergarten or 1st grade from my school teacher. I was quickly hooked by the simple and easy-to-learn block coding exercises.</p>
        <li><b>scratch.mit.edu</b></li>
          <p>I learned about Scratch during around 2nd or 3rd grade (as far as I could remember). I liked how I could create a lot of kinds of projects using Scratch and the block coding was simple but versatile. I created a few games on Scratch.</p>
        <li><b>freecodecamp.org</b></li>
          <p>I discovered freecodecamp.org later on. I liked learning coding on this website, and I got to learn a bit about HTML and CSS basics. I am now using what I learned from freecodecamp.org to create this website, but I still have a lot more to learn!</p>
