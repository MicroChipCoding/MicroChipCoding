      <ul>
        <li>Playing games, especially Roblox and Chess</li>
        <li>Coding different languages like HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Playing sports like basketball, swimming, and badminton</li>

    <h3>My Coding Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>code.org</b></li>
          <p>I first learned code.org in Kindergarten or 1st grade from my school teacher. I was quickly hooked by the simple and easy-to-learn block coding exercises.<br>Check out code.org by clicking on this image:</p>

        <li><b>scratch.mit.edu</b></li>
          <p>I learned about Scratch during around 2nd or 3rd grade (as far as I could remember). I liked how I could create a lot of kinds of projects using Scratch and the block coding was simple but versatile. I created a few games on Scratch.<br>Check out Scratch by clicking on this image:</p>

        <li><b>freecodecamp.org</b></li>
          <p>I discovered freecodecamp.org later on. I liked learning coding on this website, and I got to learn a bit about HTML and CSS basics. I am now using what I learned from freecodecamp.org to create this website, but I still have a lot more to learn!<br>Check out FreeCodeCamp by clicking on this image:</p>
